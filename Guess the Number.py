# Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number. Use a while loop to give the user multiple chances to guess, and provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed.
import random


# while True:
#     user_input=int(input("Guess the number = "))
#     num=random.randrange(1,100)
#     print(num) 
#     print("Random number generated = ",num)       
#     if user_input>num:
#        print("You guess the too high number")
#     elif user_input<num:
#         print("You guess the too low number")
#     else :
#         print("You gussed correct number")
        

print(random.randrange(1,10+1))
